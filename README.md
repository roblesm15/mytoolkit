This repository is a compilation of useful functions in R to wrangle, manipulate, and download data. Certainly, there are packages that can perform similar jobs but specific functionalities might be missing.

The first function I share downloads data from the Census APIs product. It is a work in progress but it allows the pulling of data that famous, and very well done packages like tidycensus, cannot do.
