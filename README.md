This repository is a compilation of useful functions in R to wrangle, manipulate, and download data. Certainly, there are packages that can perform similar jobs but specific functionalities might be missing.

The set of functions I share downloads data for Puerto Rico from the Census APIs product and the United Nations APIs. It is a work in progress but it allows the pulling of data that famous, and very well done packages like tidycensus, cannot do. 

The latest version of `Census_function.R` has three functions: `get_un_data`, `get_census_data` and `make_tidy_pop_estimates`. The first two pull data from the United Nations and the Census Bureau, respectively. The function `make_tidy_pop_estimates` produces a tidy data set on population estimates for Puerto Rico, effectively combining data from the Census Bureau and from the United Nations when asked. The reason I use United Nation population estimates is because some Census Bureau data estimates for Puerto Rico are not available online for years before 2000. You can combine UN and CENSUS data or ask for UN data only setting the un_data setting to TRUE. Furthermore, if you are using the UN data, you can ask up until the year 2030. The `sandbox.R` file provides a few sanity checks and a comparison for the United Nations data and the Census data for 2000 through 2021.
